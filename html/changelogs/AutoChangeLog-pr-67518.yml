  - balance: "The Quartermaster is now a Head of Staff, and answers directly to the Captain now."
  - balance: "This comes with all the stuff a Head of Staff normally has, like command access, a telebaton, and a silver ID."
  - balance: "This also comes with no longer being eligible for Head Revolutionary, and being a target for the Revolution."
  - balance: "Thanks to a savvy contract with the Space Teamsters, non-humans are allowed to be Quartermasters still."
  - balance: "The HoP is no longer the lead of Supply, nor does he have access to Supply."
  - balance: "The Warden now carries the torch for pretender royal metabolism, as the last remaining pseudo-head."
  - code_imp: "Removes a hack from the NT IRN code."
